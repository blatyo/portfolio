# Portfolio

This is a work in progress.

Imagine having a portfolio that you didn't update. Instead it updated itself based on the stuff you already do. Create a project with a README? Automatic project page on your portfolio. Keep your resume on LinkedIn and have it updated on your portfolio. 

tl;dr: keep stuff where it makes sense and have it aggregated into your portfolio.
